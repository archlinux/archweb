    <h2 class="title">About Arch Linux</h2>
<p>
Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general purpose GNU/Linux
distribution versatile enough to suit any role. Development focuses on
simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance. Arch is installed as a
minimal base system, configured by the user upon which their own ideal
environment is assembled by installing only what is required or desired
for their unique purposes. GUI configuration utilities are not officially
provided, and most system configuration is performed from the shell by editing
simple text files.  Arch strives to stay bleeding edge, and typically offers
the latest stable versions of most software.
</p>
<p>
Arch Linux uses its own Pacman package manager, which couples simple binary
packages with an easy-to-use package build system. This allows users to
easily manage and customize packages ranging from official Arch software to the
user's own personal packages to packages from 3rd party sources. The repository
system also allows users to easily build and maintain their own custom build
scripts, packages, and repositories, encouraging community growth and
contribution.
</p>
<p>
The minimal Arch base package set resides in the streamlined [core] repository.
In addition, the official [extra], [community], and [testing] repositories
provide several thousand high-quality, packages to meet your software demands.
Arch also offers the Arch Linux User Repository (AUR), which contains more than
49,000 build scripts, for compiling installable packages from source using the
Arch Linux makepkg application.
</p>
<p>
Arch Linux uses a "rolling release" system which allows one-time installation
and perpetual software upgrades. It is not generally necessary to reinstall
or upgrade your Arch Linux system from one "version" to the next.
By issuing one command, an Arch system is kept up-to-date and on the bleeding
edge.
</p>
<p>
Arch strives to keep its packages as close to the original upstream software as
possible. Patches are applied only when necessary to ensure an application
compiles and runs correctly with the other packages installed on an up-to-date
Arch system.
</p>
<p>
To summarize: Arch Linux is a versatile, and simple distribution designed to
fit the needs of the competent Linux&#0174; user. It is both powerful and easy
to manage, making it an ideal distro for servers and workstations.  Take it in
any direction you like. If you share this vision of what a GNU/Linux
distribution should be, then you are welcomed and encouraged to use it freely,
get involved, and contribute to the community. Welcome to Arch!

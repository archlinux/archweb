    <h2>Mirror Request</h2>

    <p>This page is meant as a replacement of the old way of registring as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 mirror. Previously this was done through <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/index.php?string=&project=1&search_name=&type%5B%5D=&sev%5B%5D=&pri%5B%5D=&due%5B%5D=&reported%5B%5D=&cat%5B%5D=43&status%5B%5D=open&percent%5B%5D=&do=index">https://bugs.archlinux.org</a> and would require manual intervention from the mirror maintainer(s). This process is now semi-automated and various checks against your mirror will be performed when submitting via the below form.</p>

    <h3>Available mirrors</h3>

    <p>Below are direct links to the two different tiers you will need to be acquainted with.<p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="/mirrors/tier/1/">Tier 1 mirrors</a></li>
        <li><a href="/mirrors/tier/2/">Tier 2 mirrors</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mirror information</h3>

    {% if mirror_form.is_valid or mirror_url1_form.is_valid %}
    <code>
    Your request have successfully been submitted and we will mark the mirror as public and active once we have manually verified the mirror.
    </code>
    {% else %}
    <p>Before you can submit a <b>Tier 1</b> request the mirror in question must first be a registered <b>Tier 2</b> for a certain amount of time with proven reliablity. Once the submitted information is verified by the Arch Linux mirror maintainers the mirror will be visible under the appropriate tier list above.</p>

    <form id="list-generator" method="get">
        {{ mirror_form.as_div }}
        {{ mirror_url1_form.as_div }}
        {{ mirror_url2_form.as_div }}
        {{ mirror_url3_form.as_div }}
        <p>If you are registring a <b>Tier 1</b> mirror, you need to supply the static IP to the machine that will be using rsync towards the Tier 0 mirror. This is so we can allow it to sync.
        {{ rsync_form.as_div }}
        {{ captcha.as_div }}
        <p><label></label> <input type="submit" value="Submit Request" /></p>
    </form>
    {% endif %}
</div>

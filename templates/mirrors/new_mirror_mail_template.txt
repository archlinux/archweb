 * Is the Completion % more than 98% for Tier 2 and 100% for Tier 1?
 * Does it have HTTP or HTTPS protocols?

If so, go to https://archlinux.org/admin/mirrors/, find the new mirror and mark it as Active and Public!
If the mirror hasn't synced in a couple of days, email the mirror admin asking if we can assist in any way.

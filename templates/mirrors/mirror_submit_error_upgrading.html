    <h2>Mirror Request</h2>

    <p>This page is meant as a replacement of the old way of registring as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 mirror. Previously this was done through <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/index.php?string=&project=1&search_name=&type%5B%5D=&sev%5B%5D=&pri%5B%5D=&due%5B%5D=&reported%5B%5D=&cat%5B%5D=43&status%5B%5D=open&percent%5B%5D=&do=index">https://bugs.archlinux.org</a> and would require manual intervention from the mirror maintainer(s). This process is now semi-automated and various checks against your mirror will be performed when submitting via the below form.</p>

    <h3>Available mirrors</h3>

    <p>Below are direct links to the two different tiers you will need to be acquainted with.<p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="/mirrors/tier/1/">Tier 1 mirrors</a></li>
        <li><a href="/mirrors/tier/2/">Tier 2 mirrors</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mirror information</h3>

    <pre class="error">
    
    The mirror does not meet the minimum requirements to be upgraded to a Tier 1 mirror.
    Please make sure it has been a reliable Tier 2 mirror with at most {{ TIER_1_MAX_ERROR_RATE }} errors over the last {{ TIER_1_ERROR_TIME_RANGE }} days.
    </pre>
